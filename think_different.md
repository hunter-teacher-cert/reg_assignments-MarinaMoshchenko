<b> Strategy 1. </b>  In an ideal situation I would differentiate and group students based on
their intelligence type, in accordance with multiple intelligence theory. Gardner introduced eight 
different types of intelligences consisting of: Linguistic, Logical/Mathematical, Spatial, 
Bodily-Kinesthetic, Musical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, and Naturalist.

<b> Strategy 2. </b> The more practical way is to differentiate and group students is 
by Learning Styles (categorized by sensory approaches) â€“ Visual, Auditory, Verbal [reading/writing], and Kinesthetic. 
Many people have more than one learning style, however there are certain situations in which 
one learn better based on a specific learning style. Most literature suggests that groups of 
two or four work better than groups of three. With three there is usually an odd man out. 
The best way is to put at least one student who predominates in each learning style in each group. 
The group will function better because of the contributions of each student. Learning style can
help maximize the ability to process new information. 

<b> Strategy 3. </b> Differentiating and grouping students by ability into cooperative learning.  
Unlike regular ability grouping, which puts students of similar abilities together, cooperative 
learning groups together students of mixed abilities. For example, a group of four students might 
consist of one high-achieving student, two students of average ability or performance, and one struggling student.

<i> FIVE ELEMENTS OF COOPERATIVE LEARNING: </i> 1. Positive Interdependence, 2. Face to Face Interaction, 
3. Individual Accountability, 4. Collaborative Skills, 5. Group Processing
