Podcast equity grading

To be honest, this is what I am trying to implement in my classes for the last few years. 
One that definitely works is removing the late penalty from the assignments. I am not applying it anymore. 
In terms of the points vs mastery level things, I am somewhere on developing phase. I was able to implement 
it in most cases with senior classes, but do not see this possible in my sophomore classes. The probable reasons 
for that are: 

1) Sophomores are not mature enough to take the responsibility for a quality work, 

2) AP nature of the course requires quantitative grade which correlates with AP exam score and would send the proper 
signal to the students where they are; so they would take proper actions to prepare for the exam with desired result.


I agree with many things in the podcast, such as lack of education on equity grading, 
specifics of grading underserved population, demotivating grading practices. Educators 
need to be more aware of these areas and possess more skills in grading students’ work.
However, I do thing that differentiation in offering work to students where different parts 
have different point weigh is very beneficial. Sometimes to give students choice to “scramble” points by selecting different assignments can tackle their intrinsic motivation, give them the sense of ownership and freedom of choice.
