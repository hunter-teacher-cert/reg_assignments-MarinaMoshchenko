I had quite an experience in one of the classes… It was my first year of teaching in Brooklyn Tech. 
Out of 5 classes one had a very challenging “team” of five negative leaders in that class who tried 
to put me in mildly speaking very uncomfortable situations. Most of all they were picking on my language. 
Having English as a second language, I do make mistakes sometimes and typos when I write something on 
the board or on computer. I think the whole year went with this class quite poorly. I was teaching to 
students who were between two fires – they wanted to be “cool” with peers and needed to pass the AP exam. 
The reason of teaching the class poorly was an absence of connection between us. I struggled to teach 
in this environment then, with multiple attempts to solve the issue, and would probably struggle it 
again if the kids would have the same attitude… 

The positive experience I would probably mention is related to the topics when graphic is being 
involved or explained. I highly enjoy working with images and graphics myself, and therefore can 
share my experience and my passion about it with kids. The questions they ask, I can explain deeply 
and demonstrate on the examples they can understand. The reason for that I guess is my personal 
interest, experience and interest of the kids.
