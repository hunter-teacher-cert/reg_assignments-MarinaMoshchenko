<b> Programming Task: </b> Develop a program for a Number Guessing Game, where computer would play against the user
using two different search algorithms – Linear and Binary, based on user’s choice in the beginning of the game.
Languages to use: Snap! (block-based programming language), Python or Javascript. 


<b> Possible search results: </b>

<i> Linear search algorithm with code, google results: </i>

https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linear-search (good: explains concept, visual demo, step-by-step instructions. 
Contains copy-paste-able code in Python, Java, C, C++, comments included. Level of comprehension: appropriate. Educational, useful).

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/ (good: explains concept step by step, visual demo. 
Contains copy-paste-able code in Python, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, comments included. Level of comprehension: appropriate. Educational, useful).


<i> Binary search algorithm with code, google results: </i>

https://hackr.io/blog/binary-search-in-c (good: tree diagram, explains concept step by step, visual demo. 
Contains copy-paste-able code in C, comments are not included. Might be partially educational, useful. 
Level of comprehension: too complex. Code samples are irrelevant to the course).

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/ (good: explains concept step by step, visual demo. 
Contains copy-paste-able code in Python, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, JavaScript, comments included. Level of comprehension: appropriate. Educational, useful).
Students can learn from the sources available on the internet and provided by google search engine using proper key working.
But it is also possible to find the code which can be copied as a portion of the program. 
The assignments need to be designed the way that even if part of the code is used from the internet, 
the remaining portion still need to be completed by student(s).
